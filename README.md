This is a program that reads a quiz bowl tossup question and answer, and can tell you what category it probably is based on comparing what kinds of words are used in the question with a database of known-category tossups, acquired from Quinterest.org

Currently, it is highly rudimentary, and works only by direct comparison of answerlines and comparing what words come after "this" in the question.
